- Drop item: d+[item letter]
- Access Inventory: i
- Use item: i+[item letter]

## Monsters
The player will encounter a variety of monsters in the game. Here are some of them:
- Rat (grey 'r'): Rats are weak, but they're fast and can smell the player from far away.
- Mushroom (greyish 'm'): Normal mushrooms can poison the player. Like all mushrooms, the normal mushroom does no physical damage.
- Blue Mushroom (blue 'm'); Blue mushrooms give the player the wasting effect (see below).
- Purple Mushroom (purple 'm'): Purple mushrooms blind the player for a very short time.
- Kobold (brownish 'k'): Kobolds are fairly weak, but they are able to open doors.
- Slime (green 's'): Slimes can be killed very easily, but they split into more slimes when hit.
- Redcap (red 'R'): Redcaps (a type of human-like mushroom) can open doors, give poison or blindness, and deal damage. They are most commonly encountered in heroes' bane fields (see below).
- Centipede (orange 'c'): Centipedes are fast, fairly strong, and have a nasty sting.
- Red Centipede (red 'c'): Red centipedes are like normal centipedes, but their sting also poisons the player.
- Goblin (green 'g'): Goblins are like kobolds, but stronger.
- Nenn (bluish 'n'): Nenns are similar to goblins, but resist magic.
- Yrch (grey 'y'): Yrches are stronger goblin variants that sometimes wield a poison blade.
- Bright (yellow 'b'): Brights are terrifyingly fast and strong. It's rare to survive an encounter with one.
