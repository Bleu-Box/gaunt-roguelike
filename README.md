# gaunt-roguelike
My first roguelike game. It's still in progress right now. 
The central mechanics are based on [Roguebasin's libtcod tutorial](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_roguelike_tutorial_using_C%2B%2B_and_libtcod_-_part_1:_setting_up), though I'll probably be changing a lot as it gets developed. It uses the TCOD library for C++ and has minimalist ASCII graphics.

Here's a nice screenshot of the game:

## Monsters
These are a few monsters the player might come across:
* ![r](https://github.com/Bleu-Box/gaunt-roguelike/blob/master/screenshots/rat.png "A rat") Rat - Many of these rodents live in the tunnels. They scratch and bite the player.
* ![m](https://github.com/Bleu-Box/gaunt-roguelike/blob/master/screenshots/mushroom.png "A mushroom") Mushroom - These small fungal creatures sometimes attack the player with a weak poison.
* ![R](https://github.com/Bleu-Box/gaunt-roguelike/blob/master/screenshots/redcap.png "A redcap") Redcap - Redcaps are small, mushroom-like beings that wear a blood-soaked cap. Their attack can either poison or blind the player.
* ![s](https://github.com/Bleu-Box/gaunt-roguelike/blob/master/screenshots/slimes.png "Slimes!") Slime - Although weak, slimes have the frightening ability to split into other slimes. They come in a few different colors.
