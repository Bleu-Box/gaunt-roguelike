# gaunt-roguelike
My first roguelike game. It's still in progress right now. 
The central mechanics are based on (Roguebasin's libtcod tutorial)[http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_roguelike_tutorial_using_C%2B%2B_and_libtcod_-_part_1:_setting_up], though I'll probably be changing a lot as it is developed.
