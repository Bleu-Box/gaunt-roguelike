# gaunt-roguelike
_Gaunt_ is a roguelike game based off of the [libtcod tutorial on RogueBasin](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_roguelike_tutorial_using_C%2B%2B_and_libtcod_-_part_1:_setting_up).
So far it has rats, slimes, mushrooms, and redcaps. Hopefully I'll add more things like potions, scrolls, fire, etc. eventually.
